            "prompt": "Maintain a fixed 4:3 medium shot from start to finish, camera locked on center with no zoom, pan, tilt, rotation, wobble or drift. The female character stands exactly centered; facial features, expression, hairstyle and hair color remain fully consistent and crisply defined with no quality loss. She holds a gentle, natural smile with soft micro-expressions—no stiffness, no twitching, no distortion. Lighting is soft, even, clean and neutral with no color shift. After a brief still moment, pure-white particles begin to spiral around her body, rapidly ramping to a very high density; particles are crisp, finely detailed and luminous. At peak density, a concise “magic burst” occurs—a short, bright, pure-white radial surge that fully occludes the entire frame. Only on the exact burst frame (100% coverage), perform a single-frame hard swap: the previous outfit vanishes completely and the new outfit appears fully formed and locks instantly (no blending, no fade, no delay, no partial transition, no dual exposure). New outfit: a red velvet strapless one-piece bodycon straight mini dress, perfectly fitted with a clean straight hemline—no flare, no layering, no A-line or gown expansion. Feather trim (neckline and lower hem) is pure white, 3D fluffy and floating above the velvet with visible air separation; treat feathers as a mandatory garment boundary that renders clearly and color-true immediately after the swap. Velvet shows a soft, controlled sheen with only minimal subtle sequin sparkle. After the swap, particles dissipate quickly and cleanly to reveal a stable frame. Movement: continue with a slow, elegant, soft dance—small, graceful, continuous motion; arms in short smooth arcs with relaxed wrists; subtle breathing in the waist; posture aligned and balanced; refined and calm. Framing remains a fixed centered 4:3 composition at all times. In the last two seconds, an optional very slow push to a clean medium-close keeps face, shoulders and upper body in sharp focus with natural skin tone and even light, closing on a refined, softly lit aesthetic.",
            "negative_prompt": "Beige straight-leg pants, black trousers, jeans, leggings, pant-like silhouettes; bows, bow ties, neck ribbons, chokers, necklaces, pendants, brooches or center ornaments at the neckline; straps, spaghetti straps, halter cuts, off-shoulder ruffle tiers or layered frills around the neckline; A-line spread, fishtail, flared or layered skirt volume—the outfit must remain a strapless one-piece bodycon straight mini dress. Swap/temporal artifacts: outfit fusion or layering, blending, morphing, interpolation/inbetweening/tweening, transition blur, frame blending, motion trails, residual frames, smoothing pass, ghosting, double exposure, time-stretch, frame mismatch/averaging; leftover old outfit, partial/incomplete outfit, missing trims, incorrect color/ornament; cloth growth or gradual formation, partial frame swap, misalignment, flicker, deformation, overlap, unstable fabric boundary, soft/bleeding edges. Feathers: missing or thinned neckline feather band, gaps along the front neckline, flattened/printed-on look, lace/tulle substitution, hem feathers turning into skirt frills or extending length; particle layer merging with, occluding or tinting feathers; feather color-cast (red/pink/silver/metallic). Feathers must remain pure white, 3D, fluffy, with visible air separation, always clearly visible. Face/hair: face change, rigid/forced smile, twitch, expression desync or identity morph; hair drift, flicker, transparency or particle-blending; detail loss, face blur. Motion: exaggerated dance, large arm swings, jumps/spins, rapid steps; jerky rhythm, robotic stiffness, over-bent or dislocated joints, off-axis posture, body drift—movement stays subtle and graceful. Camera/lighting: pan, tilt, zoom, slide, wobble, drift, shake, axis deviation; framing/center shift, perspective distortion, focal drift—keep fixed centered 4:3; lighting flicker, exposure pulses, color shift, metallic glare, glow bloom, LUT/grade that alters feather color.",
