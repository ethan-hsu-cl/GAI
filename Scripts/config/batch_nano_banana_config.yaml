      Create a 9:16 realistic scrapbook-style postcard collage using a vertical-stack composition centered on the canvas while keeping the original uploaded photo completely intact.The photo I provide should appear exactly as it is—without being redrawn, enhanced, altered, or replaced by any newly generated faces, or characters. It should simply be placed inside a soft-shadowed polaroid frame with a minimal border or light tape on the edges, but the image itself must remain unchanged. The background should be a clean single-color surface with subtle paper texture, gentle grain, tiny fibers, and faint notebook-style horizontal lines, without any scenery or objects—just a calm, matte paper-page feel. At the top of the collage, place a postcard paper layer with subtle fibers, ensuring it never overlaps the polaroid. Below it, include the user’s uploaded "original photo" styled as a soft-shadowed polaroid with a minimal frame or lightly taped edges. Avoid generated new photo instead original photo. Avoid any modifications to the photos. Together, the postcard and polaroid should occupy more than half of the canvas, remaining vertically centered and perfectly aligned. On the postcard, write one short poetic wish inspired by the emotion of the uploaded image: a future-focused sentence of no more than twelve words, grammatically correct, with no spelling errors, no repeated words, and avoiding openings like “Next year,” “May,” or “I hope.” The handwriting must appear messy, cozy, imperfect, and human, not clean or font-like, but don't use cursive. Add three to four small real-object elements related to the photo, each around five percent of the canvas, designed to look like actual physical materials—paper, metal, plastic, fabric, or glass. Avoid including any objects or text related to the year. These items must appear to be placed or taped naturally on the top layer, with soft realistic shadows, no white sticker outlines, and slight imperfections allowed. Include a realistic postage stamp with perforated edges among these objects. Ensure all components sit naturally with soft, non-glowing shadows, avoiding floating effects. The final image should feel like a clean, minimal, modern editorial collage photographed as a flat-lay, with neutral warm or soft lighting and a gentle analog film-inspired mood. Don't make the visual space too crowded. Please leave more blank space.

# Comments and documentation
comments:
  folder_structure: "Each task folder should contain 'Source' and 'Generated_Output' subfolders. For multi-image tasks, also include 'Additional' subfolder."
  reference_folder: "Optional: Path to folder containing third set of images for 3-way comparison"
  template_usage: "use_comparison_template: true uses comparison_template_path (3 placeholders), false uses template_path (2 placeholders)"
  model: "Gemini model to use for generation. 'gemini-2.5-flash-image' (max 3 images, faster), 'gemini-3-pro-image-preview' (max 14 images, better quality). Default: 'gemini-2.5-flash-image'. Can be overridden per task."
  resolution: "Output resolution. Options: '1K' (default). Can be overridden per task."
  use_multi_image: "Set to true to enable multi-image mode from Additional folder, false for single-image mode"
  output_group_tasks_by: "Set to 0 (or omit) to create individual reports per task. Set to N (e.g., 4) to group N tasks into one combined report. Example: with 4 tasks and group_tasks_by=4, creates 1 report; with 8 tasks, creates 2 reports."
  multi_image_config:
    description: "Configuration for multi-image generation"
    enabled: "Must be true to use multi-image features"
    mode: "sequential: consistent reproducible pairing | random_pairing: randomly select from Additional folder"
    folders: "Array of folder paths to select additional images from (typically ['../path/to/folder/Additional'])"
    allow_duplicates: "true for sequential mode (recommended) | false: try to avoid repeating combinations in random mode"
  multi_image_example_single: "Set 'use_multi_image': false to process only images from Source folder without additional images"
  multi_image_example_dual: "Set 'use_multi_image': true with multi_image_config to pair Source images with Additional folder images sequentially"
