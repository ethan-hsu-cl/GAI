      Use the uploaded person as the subject, keeping their face, facial features, hairstyle, skin tone, makeup, expression, and body proportions exactly the same as in the input photo.


      Each generated image should recreate the style found in popular social media snow-night portraits:
      a dark outdoor night background, falling snow illuminated by flash, strong direct-flash highlights on the face, crisp shadow edges, slightly overexposed skin, high contrast, and visible flash reflections on snowflakes.

      The system randomly generates one of five actions to create a portrait photo, based on the following five states. Each photo shows a person in a snowy night scene and is taken directly using the camera flash, similar to a candid street shot.

      1.Holding a transparent umbrella in the snow — standing naturally while snow falls around them.

      2.Close-up direct-flash portrait — subject looking directly into the camera with snowflakes visible at close range.

      3.Playful winter motion — subject leaning or reaching forward as if playing in the snow, showing cheerful movement.

      4.Scarf winter fashion look — subject wearing a warm scarf and posing candidly while snow falls.

      5.Winter street snapshot — subject standing on a nighttime street with snow and warm city lights behind them.

      All images must maintain:
      • a realistic night atmosphere
      • flash-lit snowflakes floating in mid-air
      • natural winter fashion styling that complements the uploaded person's look
      • no distortion, no extra limbs, no inconsistent facial appearances
      • realistic shadows and reflections
      • clean image quality, with the snow illuminated by strong direct flash
      work should present a different and realistic night snow scene, all taken using the phone's built-in flash, with a stylish and natural style, suitable for sharing on social media.

      Use the uploaded person as the only subject. Their face, facial features, expression, skin tone, hairstyle, makeup, and body proportions must remain perfectly recognizable and identical across all images. Create a four-panel 2026 New Year photo series captured within one cohesive late-night celebration moment. No other people may appear anywhere, including reflections or backgrounds.

      The visual style reflects early-2000s CCD flash photography, with strong direct flash, bright facial highlights, crisp shadows, slight digital softness, vivid saturated colors, and high micro-contrast. The flash strongly illuminates the subject against darker surroundings, creating a casual yet glamorous nightlife New Year’s Eve mood.

      The person wears a white halter-neck open-back top with a structured shoulder-cut silhouette (not thin straps), clearly exposing shoulders and back, featuring a red-toned cute illustrated graphic on the front. This is paired with a dark red body-hugging mini skirt. A faux-fur outerwear piece with a brown base mixed with black fur strands is styled consistently across all images. Makeup is glossy and defined, with expressive eyes and standout lips. Outfit, hair, and makeup remain fully consistent in all panels.

      Across the mirror, write “2026 Happy New Year” in lipstick with multiple hand-drawn heart shapes. The writing appears handwritten, playful, slightly imperfect, subtly smudged, and layered naturally over mirror reflections and flash glare, clearly visible without covering the face.

      Two images are flash-on mirror selfies.
      Over-the-shoulder open-back mirror selfie: the body turns to the right, fully revealing the open back, while the head turns back to look at the mirror. The phone is visible with flash on, and the face and upper body are clearly illuminated. The faux-fur coat is half-worn and slipping off, draped loosely around the arms so the shoulders and back remain exposed, creating a relaxed, natural, elegant look.
      Front-facing mirror selfie: the subject faces the mirror directly, holding the phone with one hand, flash on, with clear mirror glare and bright illumination on the face and upper body.

      The remaining two images naturally complement the series (not mirror selfies), maintaining identical outfit, lighting, mood, and identity. All four photos appear as if taken consecutively during the same late-night New Year moment.

      Arrange the images as a clean four-grid collage with consistent lighting, color tone, styling, and identity. The final result feels personal, stylish, intimate, and celebratory — a confident 2026 New Year flash photo series centered on self-expression and nightlife energy.

      Use the uploaded person. Their face, facial features, expression, skin tone, hairstyle, makeup, and body proportions must remain completely unchanged. Create a luxurious, cinematic, vintage European bar scene. The lighting must be dramatically low-key with platinum highlights from chandeliers and wall sconces, and the illumination should reproduce the same depth and atmosphere as the reference image. The skin should show clear dimensionality under focused highlights, while the background remains deep and shadowed, with the light wrapping softly around the shoulders and back to create a smooth, sculpted gradient from bright to dark. The overall tone must remain platinum-based rather than yellow, maintaining rich blacks, precise separation between foreground and background, and realistic reflections.

      It must be sleeveless, The evening gown must be a red satin dress with a clean, elegant open-back cut that dips low and smoothly reveals the spine line with the fabric made of heavy satin that displays fluid sheen, directional reflections, and a smooth surface. Long matching satin gloves extend above the elbows and must share the same sheen behavior as the dress.

      The pose must match natural elegance and curvature. The subject sits sideways on an ornate bar chair and turns the upper body slightly toward the camera. The back should form a graceful S-curve, with shoulders subtly angled to emphasize the open-back design. The right arm bends softly while holding a crystal wine glass at mid-chest level. The left arm rests naturally on the marble bar counter. The head turns over the shoulder with a confident, seductive, softly focused gaze toward the camera, creating the sensation of a poised and elegant moment seen from a reversed angle. Facial expression must remain calm, refined, and non-rigid.

      The environment must resemble an old European luxury bar or lounge, including heavy gold moldings, large crystal chandeliers, ornate picture frames, dark polished walls, and a marble countertop. The scene must include the complete bar setup visible in the reference image: crystal wine glasses, bottles arranged on the counter or on back shelves, metallic bar accessories, and soft reflections captured realistically in the marble surface and mirrored panels behind the subject. Background illumination must be slightly darker than the foreground but still filled with visible chandeliers and point lights creating subtle soft reflections.

      The overall atmosphere must retain polished, with painterly lighting, realistic texture, no yellow cast, and a distinctly cinematic depth that matches.

      Use the uploaded person as the subject, keeping their face, facial features, makeup, hairstyle, skin tone, and body proportions exactly the same as in the uploaded image. Create a two-panel collage composed of two identical photos, each designed in a style similar to a warm and natural outdoor photo of New Year's fireworks.

      The setting is a dark open space near water and trees, illuminated mainly by handheld sparklers and soft ambient lights in the distance. The overall mood should feel warm, romantic, slightly cinematic, and lively, with gentle bokeh from faraway lamps and a subtle night haze.

      Top : The subject must face the camera, holding a lit sparkler with one hand above the other, displaying a natural, relaxed, and happy expression.

      Bottom: Close-up of the face, facing the camera with a relaxed and cheerful expression, the frame only reaching the shoulders, no more than a super close-up. turned to the side, holding the sparkler.

      The angles of the other two photos can be varied—side view, over the shoulder, or a playful back view—but must maintain realism, conforming to realistic reflections, shadows, and human anatomy. All poses should appear relaxed and natural, as if capturing a joyful moment from a New Year's celebration.

      The subject must wear a fluffy light-colored faux-fur jacket layered over a simple black dress, with soft sparkler light reflecting on the fur and skin. Perhaps due to the movement, the fur coat naturally slipped down to her shoulders.(If the user uploads a photo of a man, he must wear a cool, stylish light-colored suede jacket, naturally layered over a simple dark inner outfit. The suede texture should catch the warm sparkler light softly, with gentle highlights reflecting on the jacket and skin. Due to natural movement, the jacket may sit slightly relaxed on the shoulders, enhancing a spontaneous, candid feel.).The lighting should replicate real handheld sparkler illumination: bright, warm spark bursts near the hands, dynamic highlights on the fur, and soft falloff into the surrounding darkness. The night background should be detailed yet subdued, containing silhouettes of winter trees, faint reflections on water, and distant streetlights or building lights with natural bokeh. Snowflakes may be present in one or two frames, softly falling and catching the light for added festive atmosphere.

      Each sparkler must emit bright, crisp, realistic sparks with slight motion blur, producing a celebratory New Year mood. Subtle sense of dynamic speed and blurThe entire collage must maintain a cohesive color tone—cool night ambient tones contrasted with warm sparkler glow. Ensure that no extra limbs, distorted hands, or impossible poses appear, and every frame should preserve the real identity and appearance of the uploaded person.

      The final collage must look like two high-quality candid New Year celebration photos captured on a phone at night, full of warmth, joy, intimacy, and festive energy.

Generate a four-frame collage of equal size, each frame feeling like a real New Year’s Eve moment captured by a handheld camera with strong, direct on-camera flash. The images must not look posed or studio-like; they must feel spontaneous, imperfect, and full of movement, as if a friend captured them during a night celebration outdoors.

Hair must move naturally in the wind, slightly messy in a flattering way, never stiff or perfectly arranged. The subject’s expressions must shift subtly between frames—real smiles, small laughs, relaxed eye contact, or glancing to the side—never the controlled expression of a formal photoshoot.

The pose must look natural and festive.the subject stands at a slight angle with the jacket slipping casually off the shoulder, not intentionally posed, and the expression is soft but unguarded.

      In the lower-left frame, the subject appears in a three-quarter-body shot on a lively nighttime street, captured in a candid celebratory moment. 

      In the lower-right frame, the subject holds a sparkler in the most natural, real-life way—Shaky camera .arm relaxed, wrist loose, not lifted deliberately for the camera—while the flash and sparkler light mix to create uneven shadows and warm reflections, and the expression shows a candid moment rather than a performance for the lens.

      The entire collage must feel like authentic nightlife snapshots: slightly imperfect, full of movement, flash-heavy, high-contrast, and emotionally alive, with no staged gestures, no symmetrical posing, and no beauty-shoot atmosphere—only the spontaneous charm of real New Year fireworks caught in fleeting moments.

      The person's face shape, makeup, hairstyle, skin tone, body proportions, and facial expression must be exactly the same as the person in the uploaded photo.

      Take a luxurious indoor party-style portrait in a warm-toned hotel bedroom.

      The woman in the photo will randomly appear in one of three situations: 1. Facing the camera, lying on a white bed, in an elegant and charming pose. She slightly tilts her head, her gaze casually fixed on the camera with a smile, exuding charm. 2. Or holding a champagne glass and smiling broadly at the camera. 3. Kneeling on the bed, holding a champagne glass (half-body shot up to her legs).

      She is wearing a light pink long-haired knit cardigan, a short design. The color is a soft milky pink with a delicate matte sheen. The fabric is made of medium-length wool blend yarn, fluffy and breathable, and the soft diffused light creates a warm and comfortable visual effect.

      This cardigan features a loose, cropped silhouette with slightly dropped shoulders and extra-long sleeves reaching to the fingertips. Its excellent drape gives it a light and airy feel, like a cloud. The front features a medium V-neck with delicate ribbed piping, and a matching button adorns the center of the neckline. The knit fabric is a loose, long-pile knit, light and flowing, while the hem and front feature a denser ribbed knit, maintaining the shape while adding softness.

      The bottom is a pair of pink long-pile knit shorts, in the same color family and similar texture as the top, creating a coordinated look. The shorts are high-waisted with a drawstring at the waist. The loose A-line silhouette drapes beautifully and reaches the upper thigh, highlighting the long, slender lines of the legs.

      For footwear, she wears off-white, fluffy mid-calf socks, thick and soft, reaching mid-calf for both warmth and a touch of femininity. Over the socks are beige, thick-soled snow boots made of matte suede or a similar material, with a rounded, comfortable shaft. The heel height is approximately 3-4 cm, complementing the style of winter loungewear and subtly adding height.

      The background must be a hotel bedroom, equipped with warm-toned wall lamps, soft ambient lighting, and artwork hanging on the wall. The perspective should be natural and cinematic, using a slightly compressed lens, a portrait lens (equivalent focal length approximately 85-105 mm). Gold and white balloons float in the air, and subtle gold and silver sequins on the sheets create a New Year's party atmosphere.

      Overall style: elegant, sophisticated, high-end fashion cinematic style, with clean and crisp visuals, realistic lighting, and a luxurious nighttime atmosphere.
