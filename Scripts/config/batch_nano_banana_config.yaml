      Please generate a hyper-realistic, cinematic portrait. The subject's face shape, look,expression, features, and hairstyle must be completely identical to the reference photo; no alterations are permitted. The bangs, all hair layers, hair outline,  must be faithful to the reference.(If the user uploads a male photo, please faithfully reproduce the original photo if the photo may contain stubble or a beard.)

      The subject cannot be covered, obscured, altered, pushed aside, pushed upwards, or have their position affected by a headband or antlers. The headband should only lightly rest on the side and back of the head, and must not overlap with any hair or affect the natural direction of any strand. Accessories must not affect the appearance of any hair. The head should be slightly turned to two-thirds of its side. The subject wears a deep emerald green, glossy satin robe with white pearl trim and a beige silk belt. The makeup is natural and soft, with a subtle rosy glow, and small festive glitter or stickers are distributed around the eyes.


      The figure wears a matte black headband and realistic reindeer antlers, the antlers gracefully curving outwards and angled forward, approximately 0.5 times the height of the head. Each antler has five slender branches, tapering naturally at the tips, and covered with a soft, matte gold powder finish, the color grading from deep warm brown to light brownish-red.

      Cartoonization, simplification, and toy-like effects are prohibited. The expression is gentle, with slightly parted lips, and the upper body fills the frame. The background is a deep emerald green studio backdrop, permanently integrated with the Trajan Pro font's gold "MERRY CHRISTMAS" all-caps arced text (It must be Text effects: Arcing text) as an inseparable, single background image. The text is always horizontally centered behind the figure's head and cannot be moved, separated, obscured, or replaced.

      The figure and antlers are always in the foreground, clearly layered with the background, and layer blending or overlapping is not allowed. The overall effect is a cinematic festive atmosphere, with soft, controllable studio lighting and hyper-realistic rendering. Cartooning, toy-like designs, simplification, layer misalignment, font errors, and distortion of details are all strictly forbidden.

  - folder: ../Media Files/Nano Banana/1118 4 Styles/1118 Christmas Snow Ball Female
    prompt: |
      Pixar-style chibi-style clay-textured Christmas snow globe, set against a realistic snowy night scene, surrounded by cool-toned pine trees and a deep blue forest, with a slightly misty, dark background highlighting the globe's brightness; fine snowflakes are falling. The slightly overhead, mid-range frontal composition focuses on the inside of the globe; the transparent glass contrasts sharply with the cool blue moonlight outside, creating a striking cool-warm effect against the warm amber light inside; the base is a double-layered matte wood carving, engraved with "MERRY CHRISTMAS". The inside of the globe is made of chibi-style clay and felt, with a smooth, matte finish and no plastic or metallic feel. Santa Claus A: large head, small body, short limbs, slightly to the left of center, wearing a red hat, white pom-pom, red coat, black belt, and black boots; his pure white hair and beard are made of clay, fluffy and rounded, with a matte, non-reflective finish; black pupil eyes, a cute and warm expression, leading the snowman-building. Character B: 0.8 times the size of A, standing on the right assisting in building the snowman. Appearance features are taken from the user-provided photo, including hairstyle, and facial expressions, presented in a chibi-style clay model. Clothing is 100% based on the user's image (Must be the same as the photo)and The Christmas outfit will only be shown if the uploaded photo shows the wearer shirtless. (Otherwise, the outfit needs to be the same as the one in the uploaded photo.). Includes a red Santa hat with white frosted edges. The background features a warm orange-lit cabin, softly lit Christmas tree lights, fluffy snow, and a cute snowman; the overall effect is a cozy, chibi-style fairytale, with the snow globe being the brightest focal point.
