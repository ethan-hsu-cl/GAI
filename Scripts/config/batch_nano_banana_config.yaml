    prompt: |
      Use the uploaded person as the subject. The subject’s face, facial features, expression, skin tone, hairstyle, makeup, and body proportions must remain exactly the same as in the input photo.

      Half-body shot, framed close enough to clearly show the person’s face and upper body. Pull the camera closer so the face appears larger, sharper, and more visible.

      The figure and the carousel are placed in the center of the image. The figure is riding a vintage carousel, leaning slightly back, with one arm raised to hold onto a bar, a slight twist of the waist, and hair gently swaying. Both the figure and the carousel must face the same direction (to the right), with bright smiles. If wearing a skirt, the figure will appear to be sitting naturally and appropriately to the side, with the skirt flowing gracefully. If wearing trousers, the figure will be interpreted as straddling the carousel.Unnatural sitting postures or contorted body positions are strictly prohibited.

      environment with warm vintage lighting matching :
      Use soft amber-orange carousel bulbs with a brighter and more vivid incandescent glow. The bulbs appear noticeably warmer and more saturated than before, leaning slightly more toward orange-gold. Increase the overall bulb brightness so the light looks clearer and more luminous, with clean golden highlights instead of bloom or haze. The carousel lights cast stronger warm orange reflections on the panels, mirrors, and horses, matching the vivid warm glow seen in the reference image.

      Keep the background extremely clean, simple, and uncluttered. No extra objects, no crowds, no decorations, no visual noise—only the essential carousel structure and glowing bulbs, with nothing else in the scene.

      Atmosphere is cinematic, nostalgic, warm, and slightly dreamy, with soft grain and warm tones.

# Comments and documentation
comments:
  folder_structure: "Each task folder should contain 'Source' and 'Generated_Output' subfolders. For multi-image tasks, also include 'Additional' subfolder."
  reference_folder: "Optional: Path to folder containing third set of images for 3-way comparison"
  template_usage: "use_comparison_template: true uses comparison_template_path (3 placeholders), false uses template_path (2 placeholders)"
  model: "Gemini model to use for generation. 'gemini-2.5-flash-image' (max 3 images, faster), 'gemini-3-pro-image-preview' (max 14 images, better quality). Default: 'gemini-2.5-flash-image'. Can be overridden per task."
  resolution: "Output resolution. Options: '1K' (default). Can be overridden per task."
  use_multi_image: "Set to true to enable multi-image mode from Additional folder, false for single-image mode"
  output_group_tasks_by: "Set to 0 (or omit) to create individual reports per task. Set to N (e.g., 4) to group N tasks into one combined report. Example: with 4 tasks and group_tasks_by=4, creates 1 report; with 8 tasks, creates 2 reports."
  multi_image_config:
    description: "Configuration for multi-image generation"
    enabled: "Must be true to use multi-image features"
    mode: "sequential: consistent reproducible pairing | random_pairing: randomly select from Additional folder"
    folders: "Array of folder paths to select additional images from (typically ['../path/to/folder/Additional'])"
    allow_duplicates: "true for sequential mode (recommended) | false: try to avoid repeating combinations in random mode"
  multi_image_example_single: "Set 'use_multi_image': false to process only images from Source folder without additional images"
  multi_image_example_dual: "Set 'use_multi_image': true with multi_image_config to pair Source images with Additional folder images sequentially"
