Hair color must remain unchanged.\n\nThe existing portrait is converted to a realistic style, preserving the subject's original facial features and distinctive characteristics. Hair color must remain unchanged.\n\nShe sits gracefully in the center of a three-dimensional card-like scene, like a pop-up holiday card. A ribbon bow is tied in the upper right corner. A surrounding red rectangle forms the outer frame of the composition, creating the illusion of a large, unfolded card enveloping her. At the top center of the background, \"Merry Christmas\" is written in elegant cursive.\n\nThe lady must gracefully kneel on a double-layered velvet table, shaped like a white cake adorned with red ribbons. The tabletop is covered with soft, long-haired faux fur, giving it a fluffy and charming appearance; both layers are decorated with horizontal red ribbons and bows.\n\nHer left leg is naturally bent, with the knee slightly higher than her hip (approximately 15-20 degrees upward). Her right leg extends diagonally downward at approximately 40 degrees, forming a soft and slender curve. The right foot rests lightly on the ground, toes slightly turned inward; the heel is slightly raised, adding tension and elegance to the overall lines.\n\nHer right arm extends forward and downward, her fingers resting lightly on the edge of the chair, forming a graceful diagonal line with her right leg. Her left hand rests gently on her raised left knee, her fingertips lightly touching the dog's back to stabilize it, while maintaining the natural curve of her wrist and fingers.\n\nThe dog must sit on her lap, positioned in the center of her left thigh, its head slightly turned towards the camera.\n\nHer chin is tilted slightly downward at about 5 degrees, her gaze fixed on the camera, a slight upturn at the corners of her mouth revealing a confident and warm smile. Her head is slightly tilted to the right shoulder, creating an elegant asymmetry that balances the composition.\n\nHer overall posture exudes a composed yet stylish aura—orderly yet relaxed. The dynamic triangular lines of her arms and legs guide the viewer's eye, ultimately landing on her face and the dog.\n\nHer torso faces the camera directly, but is slightly rotated 5-10 degrees to the left hip, maintaining a slender S-curve. Her back is straight, her shoulders relaxed and balanced.\n\nThe chair's height was proportionate to her figure, just below her knees. The soft velvet material gently reflected light, creating a warm and comfortable contrast with the minimalist studio space.\n\nThe lighting was bright yet soft, with the main light positioned at a 45-degree angle in front of her, slightly above eye level. The color temperature was approximately 5000K, creating a warm, neutral tone that highlighted the smooth texture of her skin and the soft sheen of the fabric. There were no harsh shadows; the overall image was clean, crisp, and harmonious.\n\nShe wore a red and white layered outfit. The inner layer was a fitted white turtleneck top made of fine cotton-Lycra knit fabric (approximately 180-200 grams per square meter), with a matte, smooth texture that hugged her figure while maintaining elasticity and softness. The turtleneck was approximately 6 centimeters high, hugging her neck. The sleeves were slightly longer than her wrists, creating a soft visual effect.\n\nThe outer layer was a sleeveless red wool-blend overall mini dress with a soft A-line silhouette. The dress features a deep V-neck with two fabric-covered buttons at the center. The fabric is a medium-weight twill wool (320-350 g/m²), with a subtle twill weave and a velvety softness that subtly shimmers under soft lighting. The skirt length reaches mid-thigh (approximately 42-45 cm from the waist), creating a harmonious proportion while maintaining a modern, playful feel.\n\nHer accessories perfectly complement the festive atmosphere: a red satin bow headband (approximately 5 cm wide) symmetrically worn on her head, gleaming smoothly in the light; white mid-calf ribbed cotton socks paired with burgundy patent leather Mary Jane shoes with a double-strap design, a rounded toe, and a 6-7 cm heel.",

Hair color must remain unchanged.\n\nA rebellious couple is the main focus, walking side by side through a snowy, gritty alley after a heist. They are framed perfectly in the center of the image, front-facing with a symmetrical, waist-up composition like a movie poster. Do not change the camera angle — the couple must remain exactly in the middle of the frame.\n\nThe woman must look exactly like Image1 in all aspects. Do not alter her hairstyle or facial structure. She is not wearing sunglasses. She wears a crimson red velvet jumpsuit with a form-hugging design, tailored to highlight her curves with clear body contour and visible bust shape — subtly defined through the tight fabric without excessive exposure. The neckline should be low-cut but tasteful, showing the upper chest and collarbones, suggesting sensuality without being overly revealing. The fabric is soft, slightly glossy, and drapes cleanly across her silhouette. A gold metallic belt cinches her waist as a bold fashion accent. She carries a large light brown cloth sack filled with money. The sack must not have handles or straps — do not make it look like a shopping bag. She either holds it in both arms, supports it against her hip, or rests it across one shoulder. The sack appears rugged, made of canvas or burlap, with realistic folds and texture.\n\nThe man must look exactly like Image2 in all aspects. Do not describe or reinterpret his face, hair, or expression — strictly follow the original appearance in Image2 without any modifications. He wears a red velvet Santa hat and a matching long red velvet coat with thick white fur trim. The red is vivid and saturated. Beneath the coat, he wears a tight white sleeveless undershirt with a scoop neckline that reveals part of his chest and upper abs. A wide black leather belt with a silver buckle wraps around his waist. He wears deep red velvet pants and worn black boots. He wears black aviator sunglasses.\n\nThe alley is gritty and cinematic: dirty snow, muddy footprints, scattered bills, brick buildings with rusty fire escapes, dented metal bins, and crates. Lighting combines warm orange tones from streetlamps with cool blue ambient shadows. The environment stays neutral and grounded. The couple's bold red outfits stand out as the visual focus. The scene should feel like a stylish holiday crime film — bold, alluring, and sharply composed.",

They are dressed in a delicate, textured white top, creating a soft, ethereal vibe. The pose is relaxed and contemplative, with one hand gently supporting their chin.

In the foreground, there are elegantly wrapped red gift boxes with gold ribbons, and decorative red candles.
