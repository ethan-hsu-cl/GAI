Each image maintains a 4:3 aspect ratio, capturing a cold, desaturated, and lonely winter atmosphere with delicate falling snow and a cinematic tone.\n\nThe person’s facial features and identity remain unchanged.\n\nTop frame: A close-up shot of the subject holding a transparent umbrella, dressed in a black overcoat and blue scarf, with snowflakes scattered across the scene. The person gazes melancholically toward the right, eyes full of quiet emotion.\n\nMiddle frame: A medium-wide side-view shot of the subject standing in an open snowy field, holding a transparent umbrella. The person looks toward the snowy landscape in the distance. The camera is positioned slightly to the side, capturing both the subject’s profile and the vast, snow-covered field with a line of bare winter trees in the background. The composition conveys calmness and emotional distance.\n\nBottom frame: A detailed facial close-up capturing the face and scarf. Snow rests clearly on the hair and scarf, with strands of hair slightly lifted by the wind. The soft lighting, subtle snow, and the faint edge of the transparent umbrella create a storytelling, cinematic mood.\n\nAll three images are composed into one cohesive triptych collage in a 3:4 overall format.",

Capture fine facial details and scarf texture, with snow softly resting on the hair and fabric. The soft cinematic lighting and serene expression should convey depth and emotion. Add the subtitle: “Hope that you are well.”\n\nBoth frames are seamlessly combined into a single two-image collage in a 3:4 aspect ratio, evoking natural emotion, intimacy, and quiet cinematic storytelling.",

Remove the original background completely and replace it with a realistic winter landscape of Hengdaohezi, covered in snow and softly illuminated by daylight.\nThe atmosphere should be tranquil, cold, and poetic, featuring snow falling in two distinct layers — large flakes drifting slowly and fine powder floating lightly — to create a dynamic, realistic depth of snowfall.\nKeep the original hairstyle from the uploaded portrait, ensuring the same length, shape, and texture. For longer hair, it should be deep brown with soft waves, some strands lightly dusted with snow, others catching the light in motion. The outfit includes fluffy white earmuffs, an oversized plush blue scarf, and a black wool overcoat with visible snow on the sleeves and hem.\nApply a Fujifilm Provia film filter, with soft side or back lighting that outlines the hair and snowflakes with a subtle glow. Skin should look luminous and transparent, with natural blush on cheeks, nose tip, and chin, and a gentle tinted lip gloss. The photo should feature fine film grain, a slightly hazy cinematic depth, and a nostalgic winter tone.\nPoses should look candid and emotional — such as gazing at falling snow, lightly touching the cheek, or smiling faintly. Add natural details like snowflakes on eyelashes and small props such as a snowman, the character sitting on a bench covered by snow, to add storytelling depth.\nAspect ratio: 2:3\nStyle: cinematic realism, Japanese winter film mood, Fujifilm Provia tones, fine grain, soft light.\nNegative prompt: no anime, no illustration, no facial modification, no unrealistic lighting or textures — maintain true facial resemblance, original hairstyle, and photographic realism.",

The scene has a delicate winter haze and fine film grain for authenticity.\nSkin & Detail: Keep skin realistic, translucent, and natural, showing pores and subtle blush on the cheeks and nose. Maintain the person’s exact facial proportions and expressions. Lips have a soft, warm tint.\nMood & Emotion: The subject may give a gentle smile or a calm, introspective gaze — expressing quiet warmth in a cold scene. The person hold a vintage kerosene lamp (warm yellow light) close to the face or look toward softly falling snowflakes. Do not generate closed eyes — keep a natural, open gaze.\nTechnical Details: Single photo only — no collage, no montage, no split frames.Realistic proportions (accurate head-to-body ratio, natural anatomy). Maintain cinematic depth of field with soft background blur.\nAspect ratio: 3:4\nStyle: cinematic realism, Fujifilm winter tone, fine film grain, emotional storytelling.\nNegative prompt: no anime, no illustration, no collage, no multiple photos, no closed eyes, no face or hairstyle modification — maintain true likeness, open eyes, and photographic realism.",
