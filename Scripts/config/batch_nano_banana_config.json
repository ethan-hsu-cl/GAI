            "prompt": "Transform an existing portrait into a realistic close-up while preserving the subject's original facial features and identity. Hair color must remain unchanged. The action is characterized by casual, elegant poses. The photograph was taken inside a European palace/church. A tall, dark green Christmas tree, adorned with red, burgundy, and matte gold spheres and ribbons, stands to the right. A wooden bench extends to the left, with an altar and candlelight visible in the background. The space is dominated by ivory and gold, punctuated by bronze and gold carvings and paintings. The main light is a window from the rear right, approximately 45°, with a color temperature of approximately 4800-4900K. This creates a soft, warm, golden side backlight, highlighting the reflections of the embroidery and satin. Minimal ambient fill light is provided from the front left to preserve three-dimensional shadows. This lens, with an equivalent focal length of 85-105mm and an aperture of f/2.2-2.8, creates a soft bokeh effect, framing the candlelight and Christmas tree decorations in the background. The overall color palette is a warm, neutral gold, with hints of cool green in the shadows, creating a rich sense of depth and layering. She wore an ivory court gown whose structure emulated the silhouette of 18th-century French haute couture: a corseted bodice, high shoulders, flared puff sleeves that flared at the forearm, and an elegantly dropped back. Layers of organza and a petticoat supported the dress and added volume. The primary fabric was a blend of dense silk taffeta and satin, boasting a soft, shimmering sheen and silky reflections. The gown was covered in haute couture embroidery, featuring a Rococo-inspired interwoven pattern of gold vines and burgundy flowers. The gold embroidery employed a multi-layered goldwork technique: threading and gold thread were used to create the primary vines and leaf veins. At the transitions, cut, bright gold lattice circles were connected with gold and silver thread, and felt was used to create a layered effect. The flower tips were embellished with rice beads and sparkling sequins, creating a continuous luster. The burgundy floral embroidery is composed of three layers: a matte tulle base, a middle layer of burgundy velvet and satin appliqués, and an outer layer of silk thread embroidered with long and short stitches. The stamens are clustered with gold and silver knots and gold beads. The petals are outlined with fine gold thread, giving them a soft, shimmering sheen under the light. The edges of the embroidery must be sharp and three-dimensional, never flat or blurred. The red flowers appear only at the turns and visual connections of the vines, rhythmically echoing the key decorative detail on the back. A large burgundy velvet bow is tied at the center of the back, its pile oriented in a consistent direction, creating a dense and defined structure. The bow's tail drapes naturally, creating a subtle backlighting and shadowing effect. The bow is invisible when viewed from the front. The hairstyle is styled in a low ponytail, a court-style arrangement, with loose strands framing the face. A gold crystal headpiece, inlaid with champagne and clear crystals, creates a subtle, reflective sheen. The earrings are gold long chain tassel earrings. The makeup look was based on a porcelain-like matte base, accented with champagne-gold shimmer eyeshadow and coffee-colored smudged eye makeup, lengthened lashes, and a soft rose-bean lipstick. The overall color palette was warm, with a soft gold and gentle shadows, highlighting the 3D reflective details of the satin, embroidery, and accessories. The setting had to remain within the palace and could not be moved outside.",

            "prompt": "Convert the existing portrait to a realistic style, preserving the subject's original facial features and identifying features. Hair color must remain unchanged. \nThe setting is a vintage European Christmas interior. A snow-covered Christmas tree is in the background, adorned with red ribbons, matte red and white balls, pine cones, and heart-shaped charms. Behind it are deep red velvet curtains and a carved wooden cabinet, and the floor is warm oak. In the foreground are several black and white gift boxes tied with red ribbon bows. Surrounding them are three teddy bears—one sitting under the tree, one leaning against a gift box, and one curled up in the foreground. Each teddy bear wears a red satin bow tie, and their fur is a fluffy, soft caramel brown that reflects softly in the warm light. The overall color scheme interweaves Christmas red, ivory, caramel brown, and champagne gold, creating a warm and dreamy festive atmosphere. \nShe wears a red velvet Christmas mini dress (absolutely no straps or sleeves allowed). The bodice features a sweetheart vest-like structure with a straight-line collar and a 2cm-wide white fur trim at the top. The center front is crisscrossed with red ribbon and tied into a bow. The skirt is high-waisted and puffed, reaching mid-thigh, with a 6cm-wide white fur trim at the hem. The main fabric is medium-weight velvet, lined with taffeta and light organza to support the fullness of the skirt. \nAccessories include a red velvet Santa hat with a 6cm white fur trim, white fur cuffs, and white cotton ruffled socks that rise approximately 4cm above the ankle. The dress is paired with black, shiny Mary Jane shoes with a round toe and a low 2.5cm heel. \nShe sits at the front of the chair, her posture natural and elegant. Her torso leans forward slightly, approximately 10°, maintaining a soft curve at the waist. Her left elbow rests lightly on her thigh, and her left hand touches the outside of her cheek, her fingers slightly bent and relaxed, creating a delicate 'thinking chin-rest' pose. The right hand rests naturally on his lap, gently supporting a teddy bear, fingers relaxed. \nThe legs are crossed at an angle of approximately 40–45 degrees, with the right leg folded over the left, and the toes slightly tucked in, creating a subtle pigeon-toed posture. The head is tilted slightly to the right, approximately 10 degrees, with the chin slightly tucked in. The gaze is soft and thoughtful, directed toward the camera, approximately 3–5 centimeters above the lens, with subtle highlights in the pupils. The corners of the mouth are slightly raised, approximately 5–7 degrees, with the lower lip slightly parted, creating a natural, breathy smile. \nThe main light source is a warm, soft light (approximately 3000K) from directly above and in front, illuminating the subject's face and the reflection from the gift box. A light fill of ambient light from the front left softens the shadows. The lens is a medium focal length (50–85mm) with an aperture of f/2.2–f/2.8, resulting in a shallow depth of field, transforming the Christmas tree lights into a soft bokeh. \nThe camera is positioned slightly above eye level (approximately 10–15 degrees downward). The composition is two-thirds, with the subject in the center foreground, surrounded by the gift box and teddy bear, creating depth.",

She sits with her knees together and legs crossed at the ankles on a light brown wooden floor.\n\nThe scene is a vintage European Christmas interior. To the left stands a snow-covered Christmas tree adorned with red and gold ornaments and ribbons. Behind her is a carved wooden dressing table, decorated with a Baroque-style mirror, red candles, bows, gift boxes, and a gingerbread house. The overall color palette of burgundy, ivory, and champagne gold creates a warm, festive atmosphere.\n\nThe lighting is warm candlelight from the front left, with a color temperature of approximately 2700K, creating an amber glow with soft shadows. The lens is a medium telephoto (50-85mm) with an aperture of f/2.2-2.8, creating a shallow depth of field and a soft bokeh effect.\n\nShe wore an off-the-shoulder, crimson velvet sheath dress with a six-panel bodice and a defined waist, creating a fitted, hourglass silhouette. A decorative crisscross ribbon adorned the center front, tied into a small bow at the bust.\nThe neckline was sweetheart-shaped, with a small tuft of white faux fur lining the center (not the entire neckline). The fabric was a medium-weight, short-pile velvet (velveteen), which was soft and reflective, revealing a rich depth of tone in warm light.\nA wavy white piping trimmed each bone seam, accentuating the silhouette and giving it a defined, three-dimensional feel.\n\nThe dress, with a high-waisted bell shape and crafted from curved panels, was paired with a light, horsehair or tulle underskirt for a soft, full-length look. The hem was trimmed with 4-5 cm of white faux fur, creating a soft, smooth, even hem. The skirt fell just above the knee, creating a youthful, voluminous silhouette.\n\nAccessories:\n— Headband: A large, structured, and fuzzy red velvet bow, positioned in the center of the head.\n— Wristlets: Red satin ribbon bows wrapped around both wrists, neatly tied.\n\nWhite cotton ruffled socks, with a soft, matte finish, add a touch of youthful purity. Shiny black patent leather, round-toed Mary Janes, with a single strap, add contrast and shine brightly under the studio lighting.\n\nThe makeup evokes a Christmas aesthetic of frosted glamour: matte porcelain skin, champagne gold and rose gradient eyeshadow, lengthened lashes, a matte rosy lip, and a dusky rose blush. Under candlelight, the look is clean, youthful, and exudes a soft glow.\n\nThe composition balances burgundy, ivory, and champagne gold tones, highlighting the velvety texture, fur trim, and soft lighting. The overall aesthetic evokes a romantic, retro, Christmas couture style—sweet, festive, and elegantly nostalgic.",
