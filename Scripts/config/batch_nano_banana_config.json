This portrait is surrounded by unique, cleanly background-removed (cutout) images of each individual clothing item, accessory, and shoe the model is wearing. Crucially, ensure there are no duplicate cutouts of the same item. Integrate playful, marker-style sketches, speech bubbles with fashion-related phrases, and cute decorative doodles (like hearts, stars, arrows, ribbons, flowers) around the portrait and item cutouts. The overall aesthetic should be vibrant, artistic, and undeniably cute, resembling a stylish and curated personal fashion journal page.",
