DOF: both dogs sharp, background softly separated. Framing: EXACTLY TWO DOGS ONLY — Labrador (left) and Husky (right) — behind a wooden podcast table; each has OWN mic on boom with pop filter + studio headphones; mics ~10–15 cm from muzzle. Performance: constant subtle motion (breathing, ear twitches, blinks 0.7–1.2 s, slight tail wags).\nLip-sync control:\nWhen one dog speaks, only that dog's mouth, jaw, and tongue move — the other remains in natural idle state (breathing only, mouth closed or minimal reaction).\nEach line must match its own voice with frame-level sync (±1 frame).\nIdle dog may blink or nod but never mouth motion or speech overlap.\nDialogue: two stable male voices (Lab = warm baritone; Husky = dry tenor).\nTiming lock:\n0.0–3.5s → Labrador speaks cheerfully, facing mic directly (±10°): \"Negotiations with the Roomba continue.\"\n3.5–6.0s → Husky smirks, then replies: \"We offered hair. It countered with vacuum.\"\n6.0–8.0s → both dogs laugh loudly into OWN mics; wide jaw-open (15–25°), chest/shoulders bounce (3–6°), head bobs (10–15°); maintain perfect audio–mouth sync.\nEnvironment: cozy plant-filled home, side-window diffused daylight, warm wood tabletop, tidy cables.\nQuality locks: subtle continuous zoom; no text/overlays; no extra animals; avoid over-bloom, over-sharpening, ghosting, or rolling-shutter wobble.",
