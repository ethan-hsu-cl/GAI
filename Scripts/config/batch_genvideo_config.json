Use thin, sketchy outlines, flat bold colors, childlike proportions, playful hand-drawn charm, and simple paper-cut textures. Retain the subject’s original clothing, hairstyle, facial features, accessories, skin tone, pose, and expression, but reinterpret them to match the Charlie and Lola world. Simplify clothing into flat, colorful shapes while keeping the outfit recognizable. For the background, adapt the original scene into the Charlie and Lola style, with the same whimsical flatness and hand-drawn charm. Negative Prompt: No realistic shading, no detailed rendering, no anime or manga style, no 3D modeling, no photographic textures, no realism.",
